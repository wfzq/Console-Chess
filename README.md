# Info:
Fully working 2 player game of chess instance, inside of command prompt with ASCII art using the standard FIDE ruleset.
Input is done using standard chess notation

The code is not very performant and there is no engine to play against; this was made because it would be fun
and to showcase my codes' quality.
