# Info:
Fully working 2 player game of chess inside of command prompt with ASCII art using the standard FIDE ruleset.
Input is done using standard chess notation

The code is not very performant as it looks through all squares as opposed to keeping a list and there is no engine to play against; 
this was made because it would be fun and to showcase my ability to write good code. Whether I succeeded is up to you.

It does not use external libraries so getting it up and running should be easy
